JLog is a simple logging framework written in PHP. It is intended to be used
for development debugging purposes but should be flexible enough for logging
deployed applications as well.

Logs are dumped in JSON format to make them easy to be machine readable for
parsing by external tools.

Our goal is to provide a flexible number of log storage solutions (flat file, 
database, network, etc...).
